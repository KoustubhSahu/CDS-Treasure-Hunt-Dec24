## Overview

**Ticket to Treasure Hunt** is an interactive holiday-themed treasure hunt web app. This app provides users with a series of riddles that they must solve to eventually discover the location of a hidden gift. After solving the clues, users will be prompted to enter a 3-word password. Once the correct password is entered, they will be redirected to a "Congratulations" page revealing the gift's location.

This web app was created for fun holiday challenges and utilizes simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user experience.

## Key Features
- **Password Input Page:** Users can enter a 3-word password to unlock the final gift location.
- **Hint Option:** A hint button provides users with a clue for how to derive the password.
- **Congratulations Page:** After submitting the correct password, users are congratulated and shown the location of the gift.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring the web pages
- **CSS3** for styling and creating the layout
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality (password validation and hint display)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files directly.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the treasure hunt.
3. To run the app locally:
   - Ensure that all files (`index.html`, `congratulations.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`) are in the same directory.
   - No server setup is required as the app runs directly from the browser.

## How to Play
1. Go to the **Password Input Page** and enter the 3-word password, which is derived from solving clues in the treasure hunt.
2. If you get stuck, click the **Hint** button for a clue.
3. Once you enter the correct password (which is "ticket to ride"), you will be redirected to the **Congratulations Page** where you'll find the gift location.

## Gift Location
The gift is hidden in the cubicle opposite Debby's office, next to Carolina's cubicle. Check out the image of the drawer on the congratulations page to help locate it!

## Folder Structure
- **index.html**: First page where users input the password.
- **congratulations.html**: Second page showing the gift location and congratulations message.
- **styles.css**: Styling for the web pages.
